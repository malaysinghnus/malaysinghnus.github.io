					<!-- <dd> <b>June 2017 -   </b> --!> <br>
						<dd><p align="justify">
					Architecture, size, and shape of glands are most important patterns used by pathologists for assessment of cancer malignancy in prostate tissue slides. Varying structures of glands along with cumbersome manual observations may result in inaccurate assessment. Cribriform gland with irregular border is an important feature in Gleason pattern 4. We are developing a deep learning based cribriform pattern classification system, which uses several pre-trained deep learning models that were fine-tuned with our own labelled H&E image dataset. These fine-tuned deep learning models provide us pre-defined features derived from natural images which are transferred to histopathological imaging domain. We have achieved promising results with these fine-tuned deep learning models.

					The characteristics of the nuclei are often observed by pathologists when they assess the progression and presence of cancer cells in tissue biopsies. Cancerous tissue typically contains cells with enlarged, irregularly-shaped (pleomorphic) and darkly-stained (hyperchromasia) nuclei with prominent nucleoli. However, at different stages of the disease, the nuclear structure and prominence of nucleoli can change. The Fuhrman grading system for clear cell Renal Cell Carcinoma (ccRCC) was developed around these observed changes in the nuclei. It provides rules to classify the different stages of disease progression. Early stage ccRCC tumors typically have small, round nuclei with inconspicuous nucleoli, while late stage tumors have enlarged and irregularly-shaped nuclei with prominent nucleoli. Following on from our work on nucleoli detection, we have developed new machine learning methodologies to perform automatic grading of ccRCC histopathological images. From the histopathological images, we extract features describing the properties of multiple nuclei concurrently. This enables us to train classifiers that can distinguish the level of pleomorphism of the nuclei in the tissue sample, resulting in a higher accuracy in the automated grading.

					The evaluation of both asymptomatic patients and those with symptoms of liver disease involves blood testing and imaging evaluation. 
					We developed an automated image based tumor risk assessment system as part of 
					a micro-array gene expression based prognostic stratification system for resectable hepatocellular   carcinoma. Whole slide images of liver cancer tissue were divided into two groups namely "Low Risk" and "High Risk"  by micro-array gene expression based prognostic stratification system.   These slides were then immunohistochemically (IHC) stained for different biomarker proteins. We   developed an automated image based system to analyse the biomarker protein content.   Our system predicted a Support Vector Regression (SVR) based score for each IHC image after quantification and analysis of stain.  Our system was able to predict a higher SVR score for "High risk" patients when compared to "Low Risk" patients.

					Glandular structural features are important for the tumor pathologist in the assessment of cancer malignancy of prostate tissue slides. The varying shape and size of glands combined with tedious manual task can result in inaccurate assessment. There are also discrepancies and low level agreement among pathologists especially in cases of Gleason pattern 3 and pattern 4 prostate adenocarcinoma. We have developed an intelligent software to improve accuracy and reduce labor of gland structure assessment on Haematoxylin and Eosin (H&E) stained prostate tissue slides. Our method can easily fit into the existing workflow of the pathologist. Prostate cancer glands with their varying shapes, structures, and size pose an extreme challenge for automated gland segmentation systems. Our method achieved an averaged Jaccard Index score of 0.54 (range is [0,1], higher value is better) while outperforming various existing softwares in the literature.

					The Project  presents an approach to multi-modal processing in speech technology. We suggested and implemented the idea of how a Speech corpus
					containing large 
					amount of audio data can be transcribed offline and used on-the fly by a simple text index. We proposed  a novel  approach to corpus
					storage in groups which would help in turn to categorize the data stored. During retrieval process the groups to be searched may be defined.
